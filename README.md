<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  My name is Jose Luis Santiago and I am a Computer Engineering
  graduate from UCSC with a background in Embedded Systems and
  Web Development. I am currently studying Web Development
  through The Knowledge House fellowship. My preferred
  programming languages are C++ and JavaScript. One
  accomplishment I am proud of is how I led a group of 3 to
  complete a full stack e-commerce website within a 1-month
  timeframe. 
</p>
<p>
  Inspired by a childhood love for games, I‚Äôm eager
  to apply my technical skills to a role where my patience and
  competitive nature can drive impactful solutions. I aim to
  inspire others the way video games inspired me.

      <td><p>During my time in undergrad at UCSC, my Computer Engineering concentration was in Robotics and Control. I learned advanced programming in C++ and Embedded Programming in C. My senior capstone was an IoT device which monitored parameters indicative of wildfire risk. I was on the hardware team responsible for implementing the microcontroller and sensors. </p></td>

        <p>I was introduced to Web Development after graduating from college via a 1 month internship with a startup, Arrow. I led a 3-intern group to create an MVP of an e-commerce website for heavy machinery. By the end of the month we successfully created a prototype with Stripe API implementation. I am also currently a Web Development Fellow with The Knowledge House.</p>

        <p>Video games are what sparked my curiosity for technology and led to my journey in tech. I want to create a game that moves people the way games like Super Mario World and Pokemon moved me. Since graduating I've been working on an independent game project as the sole developer. The title of the game is Purgatory. It is a pixel art RPG of a typical hero's journey through a post-capitalist society.    </p>

        The purpose of this lab was to design a sequential circuit to program our Basys 3 board to
        play the game ‚ÄúRainbow Road.‚Äù The Basys board has a VGA output to enable a The objective of the
        game is to keep a car on the Rainbow Road. The road randomly generates at the top of the screen as the
        car drives up the road. The buttons btnL and btnR on the Basys board control the left and right steering
        of the car. As long as any portion of the car remains on the road, the game continues. The score
        increments as long as the car remains on the road as well. The game ends once the car fails to make
        contact with any of the road. The difficulty of the game can be increased by using switches 4-6 to dictate
        the width of our road segments.

        This lab was an introduction to quadrature encoders, time based sensors, and capacitive
        sensors. The quadrature encoder used in this lab is a rotary switch with an RGB LED. The
        objective for this device is to implement the quadrature encoder interface (QEI) to determine the
        position of the encoder and drive the color of the RGB LED as appropriate. The time based
        PING sensor will be used to measure the distance of the sensor to various objects. The PING
        sensor will have to be linearized using Least Squares. The capacitive touch sensor will be used
        to experiment with several techniques to measure change in capacitance. Every sensor will
        need modular non-blocking code developed for the sensor, enabling the user to interact with
        them and read them.
