<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  My name is Jose Luis Santiago and I am a Computer Engineering
  graduate from UCSC with a background in Embedded Systems and
  Web Development. I am currently studying Web Development
  through The Knowledge House fellowship. My preferred
  programming languages are C++ and JavaScript. One
  accomplishment I am proud of is how I led a group of 3 to
  complete a full stack e-commerce website within a 1-month
  timeframe. 
</p>
<p>
  Inspired by a childhood love for games, Iâ€™m eager
  to apply my technical skills to a role where my patience and
  competitive nature can drive impactful solutions. I aim to
  inspire others the way video games inspired me.

<h3>Embedded Programming</h3>
<p>During my time in undergrad at UCSC, my Computer Engineering concentration was in Robotics and Control. I learned advanced programming in C++ and Embedded Programming in C. My senior capstone was an IoT device which monitored parameters indicative of wildfire risk. I was on the hardware team responsible for implementing the microcontroller and sensors. </p>

<h3>Web Development</h3>
<p>I was introduced to Web Development after graduating from college via a 1 month internship with a startup, Arrow. I led a 3-intern group to create an MVP of an e-commerce website for heavy machinery. By the end of the month we successfully created a prototype with Stripe API implementation. I am also currently a Web Development Fellow with The Knowledge House.</p>

<h3>Game Development</h3>
<p>Video games are what sparked my curiosity for technology and led to my journey in tech. I want to create a game that moves people the way games like Super Mario World and Pokemon moved me. Since graduating I've been working on an independent game project as the sole developer. The title of the game is Purgatory. It is a pixel art RPG of a typical hero's journey through a post-capitalist society.    </p>
